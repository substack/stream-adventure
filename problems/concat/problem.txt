You will be given text on process.stdin. Buffer the text and reverse it using
the `concat-stream` module before writing it to stdout (using console.log).

`concat-stream` is a write stream that you can pass a callback to get the
complete contents of a stream as a single buffer. Here's an example that uses
concat to buffer POST content in order to JSON.parse() the submitted data:

    var concat = require('concat-stream');
    var http = require('http');
    
    var server = http.createServer(function (req, res) {
        if (req.method === 'POST') {
            req.pipe(concat(function (body) {
                var obj = JSON.parse(body);
                res.end(Object.keys(obj).join('\n'));
            }));
        }
        else res.end();
    });
    server.listen(5000);

In your adventure you'll only need to buffer input with `concat()` from
process.stdin.

Make sure to `npm install concat-stream` in the directory where your solution
file is located.

Console.log is specified explicitly above simply to match the output of the
solution script. The solution uses console.log, which appends a final newline
character to the output. If process.stdout.write is used a trailing newline
character will be missing & the output won't `verify`.
